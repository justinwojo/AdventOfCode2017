## Day 1
#### Part 1
Find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the list.

#### Part 2
Instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the digit halfway around the circular list.

## Day 2
#### Part 1
Calculate the spreadsheet's checksum. For each row, determine the difference between the largest value and the smallest value; the checksum is the sum of all of these differences.

#### Part 2
Find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line's result.
